2016 Bitcoin Foundation Plan Outline Draft

For member comment.


Vision:  To serve as an international platform for a network of individuals and companies who seek to further development and adoption of Bitcoin and related technology.

Mission:  To help advance Bitcoin and related technology through education advocacy and outreach across the globe by focusing on three primary areas: 

1) Fostering Core Development
2) Furthering education & adoption
3) Working to limit harmful regulations and encourage technical rather than regulatory solutions

Structure:  The Bitcoin Foundation is based in Washington DC and is structured as a 501c(6) non-profit organization.  Membership is comprised of individuals and corporate members globally.

The Bitcoin Foundation does not represent the core technology nor have any control over Bitcoin itself.  The Bitcoin Foundation is international and focused on the technology in all areas of the world, not any particular country or region.  The foundation believes in the core features of Bitcoin such as fungibility and avoiding any segregation of Bitcoins based on origin or previous usage and the features described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto such as the 21 million coin limit.


Specific focus areas:

FOSTERING CORE DEVELOPMENT
The foundation seeks to foster core development by increasing knowledge about development and increase in the number of developers involved in Bitcoin core and other programming activities of benefit to the overall Bitcoin ecosystem.

The primary tool for this is the DevCore conference series which is designed to "Develop the Developers" there have so far been three DevCore events: London, Boston and San Jose.  

The events have included as faculty well known leading developers and technical experts such as Greg Maxwell, Gavin Andresen, Charlie Lee, Jeff Garzik, Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Matt Corallo, Jeremy Allaire, Michael Perklin, Sean Neville and others. 

Additional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.

The foundation Chief Scientist is Gavin Andresen.
The foundation also wishes to create a Technical Communications Committee which will be chaired by someone with significant knowledge about core development.  The primary role of this committee will be to bridge the gap between core development and the public and business leaders by updating members of the industry on current events in development and what they mean to the Bitcoin industry.


FUTHERING EDUCATION & ADOPTION
The foundation aims to educate individuals, corporations, government agencies, no profit organizations and others and to encourage adoption of the technology.
We seek to support activities which increase the number of overall users and the overall general public knowledge.  As part of this effort are included several initiatives:
The Bitcoin Foundation Education Committee – currently chaired by Colin Gallagher 
The Bitcoin Foundation Adoption Committee (not yet filled)
The Bitcoin Foundation Speakers Bureau – A matching service for speakers.  Speakers include Roger Ver, Anthony DiIorio, Michael Terpin, Matt Roszak, Jeff Garzik, Perrianne Boring, Paul Snow, Nick Spanos, Nick Sullivan, Nicolas Cary, Erik Voorhees, Connie Gallippi and others.
The Bitcoin Foundation Press Referral Program which matches Bitcoin experts with members of the press.


LIMITING REGULATIONS
The Bitcoin Foundation believes that all efforts possible should be made to avoid new regulations governing Bitcoin and related technologies.

We believe that it is most effective to focus on technical solutions rather than regulatory solutions such as by encouraging usage of multi-sig keys, solid audit standards, exchange proof of reserves and other technical based activities.

We believe in educating lawmakers, with a focus on elected officials or the most senior officials possible in jurisdictions without elections and explaining the benefits and core features of Bitcoin as well as offering non-regulatory suggestions and solutions.

This activity is carried out by groups and members such as the
Bitcoin Foundation Regulatory Affairs Committees led by Attorney Marco Santori.  The Regulatory Affairs Committee created one of the most comprehensive replies to the original NY Bitlicense, addressing the more onerous provisions of the originally proposed regulation.
